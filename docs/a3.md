Issue: textarea setRangeText(): byte index 1 is not a char boundary.<br/>
Diagnosis: This happens when "setRangeText" is called on multi-byte characters. textinput.rs fails to determine the correct character boundaries. This issue might be caused by the use of the subscript opreator - '[]', for byte indexing in textinput.rs.<br/>
Proposed solution: Need to add some sort of a check before indexing, or use an alternate method (something like "get" for python dicts).<br/>
Testing: Issue is tested manually using the input provided in the issue description.<br/>
