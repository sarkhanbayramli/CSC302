Issue: textarea setRangeText(): byte index 1 is not a char boundary.<br/>
Diagnosis: This happens when "setRangeText" is called on multi-byte characters. textinput.rs fails to determine the correct character boundaries. This issue might be caused by the use character indices in slicing, rather than byte indices.<br/>
Proposed solution: Count the corresponding number of bytes instead of characers.<br/>
Testing: Issue is tested manually using the input provided in the issue description.<br/>
