Issue: textarea setRangeText(): byte index 1 is not a char boundary.
Diagnosis: This issue might be caused by the use of the subscript opreator - '[]', for byte indexing in textinput.rs. 
Proposed solution: Need to add some sort of a check before indexing, or use an alternate method (something like "get" for python dicts).
Testing: Issue is tested manually using the input provided in the issue description.
